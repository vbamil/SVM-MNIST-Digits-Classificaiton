# SVM-MNIST-Digits-Classificaiton

In this notebook, we'll explore the popular MNIST dataset and build an SVM model to classify handwritten digits. 

We'll divide the analysis into the following parts:

Data understanding and cleaning
Data preparation for model building
Building an SVM model - hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation etc.
